## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Code Review**
   - All code changes must go through peer review
   - Security-sensitive code requires additional review
   - Use static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Use strong password policies
   - Implement proper session management
   - Follow the principle of least privilege
   - Use secure token generation for API authentication

3. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
   - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
   - Implement proper input validation and sanitization
   - Follow secure file upload practices

4. **Infrastructure Security**
   - Keep all dependencies up to date
   - Use secure configurations for production servers
   - Implement proper logging and monitoring
   - Regular security audits and penetration testing

### For Users

1. **Account Security**
   - Use strong, unique passwords
   - Enable two-factor authentication if available
